Fatal police shooting …

Is it a civil right violation of citizens by abusing power or an act of self defense?

This project is about fatal police shootings in the United States between 2013 and 2018. 

Our main focus here is on features of each shooting and the demographics of the cities and states that shootings took place, in order to find patterns or the possible relation between shootings and the ethnicity background, gender and the age bracket of the deceased. 

FBI and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal police shootings, but they acknowledged that their data is incomplete. I hoped to work with official data, but in the absence of official records I went with the second choice which was unofficial resources. Dataset for this project was accumulated mostly from Washington Post database. 

Washington Post as the main source of data reveals a selection bias for our dataset. Deeper look into audiences/ readers of Washington Post shows lack of diversity, as the great portion of the readers can be considered educated middle class people in big or mid size cities. It’s also fair to assume that not all of audiences/ readers were aware of the campaign of collecting records for fatal police shootings. So clearly there were incidents that were never reported to Washington Post. 

At last, we need to clarify what sort of incidents were covered in this report. This dataset only include incidents that civilians were fatally shot by active duty police officers.
